README for NightlyBuild

The NightlyBuild scripts are made for the automatic download, configure, build, and test of COIN-OR projects.
If a failure is recognized, NightlyBuild can send an e-mail to the corresponding project manager.
NightlyBuild can also be used to generate automatically binary distributions of COIN-OR projects.
The main program is nightlyBuild.py

For each supported COIN-OR project a set of build types can be specified.
A build type is a tuple of information containing the
- SvnVersion: which version from the repository to built (trunk, latestStable, latestRelease, stable/0.1, ...)?
- OptLevel: should the code be build in optimized mode ("Default") or debugging mode ("Debug")
- ThirdParty: should it be allowed to use third party codes
- SkipProjects: a list of COIN-OR projects (from the externals) that should be skipped in the build
- AdditionalConfigOptions: additional flags for the configure call

For such a build type, NightlyBuild does
1. Checkout the specified version from the svn repository (https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/<project>/...).
2. Download third party codes for which get.XXX scripts can be found.
3. Assemble the parameter for the configure call.
4. Call configure. If there is an error, send a failure report as e-mail and break.
5. Call make. If there is an error, send a failure report as e-mail and break.
6. If the project has a test program, call make test. If there is an error, send a failure report as e-mail and break.
7. If the project has unit tests, call the unit tests. If there is an error, send a failure report as e-mail and break.

There are also rules implemented to avoid the rebuild and test of a project if there has been no change in the code since the last build.
The failure reports contain, next to information about the build type and the system, also the output to stdout and stderr.
The output of get.XXX scripts, configure, make, unittests to stdout and stderr is also stored in the build directories for later analysis (e.g., NBmake.stdout).

To install and use NightlyBuile please see the INSTALL file.
