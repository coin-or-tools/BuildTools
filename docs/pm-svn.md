# Understanding Subversion



[Subversion](http://subversion.apache.org) (SVN) is a *version control system*.  It is the successor of CVS.  It shares many of the features and commands of CVS, but is more powerful, and some details are different.  The COIN-OR repository is organized by subversion.

A detailed manual for subversion is the [Subversion Book](http://svnbook.red-bean.com).
If you have used CVS before and want to know how subversion related to CVS, you should look at the ["Subversion for CVS Users" appendix](http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.forcvs.html) of the Subversion Book.  A major difference to CVS is that you can do most operations off-line, such as `diff`, without having to be connected to the internet.  Also, in contrast to CVS, subversion is able to properly handle revisions of directories.

On the pages behind the following links, we intend to give all the information necessary for a project manager that is necessary to interact with the COIN-OR svn server.
